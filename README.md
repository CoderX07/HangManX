# HangManX
Do you ever scroll through HTML/Python/Node.js games and wonder "hey I wanna play a game that's new and not clickbait."  

Probably Not, but still.  

Let me present: HangManX!!  

Basically, it's hangman coded in Python. Some of the words are easy, but don't let that fool you! Some are virtually impossible (trust me - I coded the words and I struggled with some). The code is case-sensitive, so make everything LOWERCASE.  

If you don't know how to play Hangman click the link below:(Only Steps 4 and 7 Apply, since I already hardcoded or excluded the other steps)  https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman#:~:text=How%20to%20Play%20Hangman%201%20Choose%20one%20person,word%2C%20begin%20guessing%20which%20letters%20...%20See%20More.  

Basically, If You Were Lazy And Didn't Read The Top Portion (I understand):  **The code is case-sensitive, so make everything LOWERCASE.** 

That's all! Hope you enjoy!!
